Animal Shelter
The Scottish Animal Shelter accepts orphaned or stray animals and takes care of them until they can be adopted by a new owner. The shelter has a list of potential new owners for the animals. Animals may take a while to be trained up and made healthy before being available for adoption.
They are looking for a management system to keep track of their animals and owners.

MVP:
A list of all their animals and their admission date
Mark an animal as being adoptable/not adoptable
Assign an animal to a new owner
List all the owners and their adopted animals

Possible Extensions:
CRUD actions for animals/owners
Have separate pages for animals ready for adoption and ones still in training/vet care
Search for animals by breed/type
Any other ideas you might come up with
